# MCU Natural User Interface

The MCU Natural User Interface is a Unity-based application that allows users to interact with a virtual environment using sign language gestures for vowels and numbers. The interface utilizes the Leap Motion V2 device to track hand movements, providing real-time feedback through audio and visual cues.

## Features

### Current Features

- Real-time hand tracking: The Leap Motion V2 device accurately tracks hand movements, enabling users to input sign language gestures for vowels (A, E, I, O, U) and numbers (1-5).
- Audio and visual feedback: The interface provides immediate feedback through audio output and on-screen images, helping users understand the recognized sign and facilitating communication.

### Future Features

- Expandable character set: The interface can be extended to include additional letters and numbers, allowing for a more comprehensive sign language learning experience.
- User-controlled audio output: Users can have the option to control when the interpreter speaks, providing a more personalized and interactive experience.
- Text-to-speech integration: Text-to-speech functionality can be incorporated to enhance the user experience by providing spoken instructions and feedback, as well as the ability to communicate complete sentences.
- Tutorial mode: A more detailed tutorial can be implemented to guide users on how to use the application.
- Learning mode: A learning mode can be added to the interface to help users learn sign language by providing a list of signs and their corresponding letters and numbers.
